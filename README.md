## The idea
Main use is to recreate instagram chats to comfortly read old messages, 
but can be used for:
* [Find information in json files](#get_index)
* [Resave long json files to short and more comfotable work](#save_file)

## How to use?
1. Open 'Extractor.py' file and write the name of your chat mate.
2. [Open 'index.js' file and change 'your_username' - at line 20.](#JS change name)
3. Open 'index.html' and that's it.
